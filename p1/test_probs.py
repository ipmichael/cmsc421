########## Test problems for Project 1 -- Dana Nau, 2015.09.25 ##########
#
# Each test problem is a list of the following form: [p0, finish, walls].
# Thus if your project in a file named proj1.py, and these problems are
# in a file named test_probs.py, you can do something like this:
#
#	import proj1, test_probs
#	(p0, finish, walls) = test_probs:rect1
#	proj1:find_path(p0, finish, walls, proj1.heur)
